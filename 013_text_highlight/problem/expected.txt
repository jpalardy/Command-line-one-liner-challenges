CHAPTER II

SATURDAY morning was come, and all [1;31mthe[0m summer world was bright and
fresh, and brimming with life. There was a song in every heart; and if
[1;31mthe[0m heart was young [1;31mthe[0m music issued at [1;31mthe[0m lips. There was cheer in
every face and a spring in every step. The locust-trees were in bloom
and [1;31mthe[0m fragrance of [1;31mthe[0m blossoms filled [1;31mthe[0m air. Cardiff Hill, beyond

[1;31mthe[0m town pump had always been hateful work in Tom's eyes, before, but
now it did not strike him so. He remembered that there was company at
[1;31mthe[0m pump. White, mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always there
waiting their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling,
fighting, skylarking. And he remembered that although [1;31mthe[0m pump was only

him. Tom said:
